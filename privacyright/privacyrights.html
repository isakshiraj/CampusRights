            <p  style="color: white;">Privacy rights are the protections and controls you have over your personal information and how itâ€™s collected, used, and shared by your college. Understanding these rights helps you safeguard your personal and academic data. Privacy in education encompasses ideologies, practices, and legislation focused on protecting individuals' privacy rights within the education system. Key concepts include the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy_(United_States)">expectation of privacy</a>, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy">right to privacy</a>, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a>, the Fourth Amendment and the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a>. Central concerns involve safeguarding student data, such as educational records and personal information, and ensuring the privacy of medical records.
